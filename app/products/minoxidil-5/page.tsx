    howItWorks:
      "Apply 1ml of Minoxidil solution directly to the affected areas of your scalp twice daily (morning and evening). Use the included dropper to measure the correct amount. Gently massage into the scalp and allow to dry completely before styling your hair. Do not wash your hair for at least 4 hours after application. Results typically become visible after 2-4 months of consistent use, with optimal results seen after 6-12 months.",
    aboutTreatment:
      "Minoxidil USP 5% is the only FDA-approved over-the-counter treatment for androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness). Originally developed as a blood pressure medication, researchers discovered its hair growth properties as a side effect. Clinical studies show that 5% minoxidil is significantly more effective than 2% concentration, with 45% of men experiencing moderate to dense hair regrowth after one year of use. The treatment works by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, which allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to reach hair follicles. This process can reverse the miniaturization of hair follicles and extend the growth phase of the hair cycle.",
