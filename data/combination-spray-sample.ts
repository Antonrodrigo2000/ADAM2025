  how_it_works:
    "This combination treatment works through two complementary mechanisms: Minoxidil increases blood flow to hair follicles, delivering essential nutrients for growth, while Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT (dihydrotestosterone) directly at the scalp level, preventing further hair loss and allowing dormant follicles to reactivate.",
  expected_timeline:
    "Initial shedding may occur in weeks 2-4 as weak hairs are replaced. New hair growth typically begins around month 2-3, with significant improvement visible by month 4-6. Maximum benefits are usually achieved by month 12.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Why is this more effective than minoxidil alone?",
      answer:
        "The combination addresses hair loss from two angles: Minoxidil promotes growth while Finasteride prevents further loss by blocking DHT. This dual approach provides superior results compared to single-ingredient treatments.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a prescription for this combination spray?",
      answer:
        "Yes, this product contains Finasteride which requires a prescription. You'll need to complete our online consultation or book a video call with one of our licensed physicians.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is topical finasteride safer than oral finasteride?",
      answer:
        "Yes, topical finasteride has significantly lower systemic absorption (less than 1% compared to 65% for oral), reducing the risk of side effects while maintaining effectiveness at the scalp level.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I use this treatment?",
      answer:
        "Hair loss treatment is typically a long-term commitment. Most users continue treatment indefinitely to maintain results, as stopping will gradually return hair loss to its natural progression.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this with other hair styling products?",
      answer:
        "Yes, but allow the spray to dry completely (about 2-4 hours) before applying styling products. We recommend applying the treatment at night for best results.",
