  how_it_works:
    "This combination therapy works through two complementary mechanisms: Minoxidil increases blood flow and nutrient delivery to hair follicles, while Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the primary hormone responsible for male pattern baldness. Together, they provide comprehensive hair loss prevention and regrowth.",
  expected_timeline:
    "Initial stabilization of hair loss occurs within 3-6 months. New hair growth typically begins around month 4-6, with significant improvement visible by month 8-12. Maximum benefits are usually achieved after 12-18 months of consistent use.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How is this different from using minoxidil alone?",
      answer:
        "The combination addresses hair loss from two angles: minoxidil stimulates growth while finasteride prevents further loss by blocking DHT. Studies show combination therapy is significantly more effective than either treatment alone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a prescription for this product?",
      answer:
        "Yes, this is a prescription medication that requires consultation with one of our licensed physicians. Finasteride requires medical supervision and monitoring.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there fewer side effects compared to oral finasteride?",
      answer:
        "Yes, topical application significantly reduces systemic absorption, leading to fewer side effects while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness at the scalp level.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long before I see results?",
      answer:
        "Most patients notice reduced hair loss within 3-4 months. New growth typically becomes visible around month 6, with optimal results achieved after 12-18 months of consistent use.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this with other hair products?",
      answer:
        "Wait at least 4 hours after application before using styling products. Avoid harsh shampoos or treatments that might interfere with absorption. Consult your physician about other hair treatments.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I miss applications?",
      answer:
        "Consistency is key for optimal results. If you miss a dose, apply as soon as you remember, but don't double up. Missing occasional applications won't significantly impact long-term results.",
    },
